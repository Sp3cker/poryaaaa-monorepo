/* Software m4a driver.  Mirrors the real m4a routines from the
 * pokeemerald disassembly (Music 4 Advance / Sappy / MPlayDef).
 *
 * Status (2026-04-29): MIDI ingress drives real CGB + DirectSound
 * channel state; m4a_advance fires SoundMain at vblank cadence
 * (CgbSound + SoundMainRAM + SoundMainRAM_Reverb + LFO tick).  The
 * register-file (M4ARegisterFile) and PCM ring (M4APcmRing) are the
 * authoritative driver→chip outputs.  Driver side is now feature-
 * complete for the parity targets we care about — §12 step 1's LFO
 * advancement landed (m4a_internal_lfo_tick in m4a_track.c, fired
 * from m4a_main.c's tempoC overflow loop); MPlayMain song-walk
 * remains a deliberate no-op because the DAW is the song player.
 * §12 step 2 PCM mixer + reverb still needs a verification audit
 * against v1 and real m4a before this output is a valid parity
 * baseline.  Audibility is achieved end-to-end behind v2 flags;
 * mGBA capture-comparison parity (§12 step 10b) remains the open
 * parity gate — see plan §12 blocking-gates list. */

 * segments its render span at each event's sample_offset and applies
 * the write at that boundary, exactly as mGBA does with
 * GBAAudioSample() + write.
 *
 * The snapshot (M4ARegisterFile) is still computed as a side effect and
 * remains queryable via m4a_get_register_file() for non-timing

 * onwards MUST drive off the event stream — using the snapshot for
